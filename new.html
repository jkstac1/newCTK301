    <main><p class="p1">Hi there! Welcome to my website. I am currently a senior at <span style="isu">Illinois State University</span> studying Communications. My path is Mass Media: Promotions and Sales. I am very fortunate to have taken CTK 301 with Rick Valentin -- my goal this year was to dig into coding and web design in order to further enhance my creative abilities in this field of work. I look forward to my future when I graduate this year and all of the exciting things the world has to offer! I am ready to share everything I have learned thus far.
    </p>
     <p class="p2">My goals and aspirations are to find what I am good at and most importantly what I enjoy. My hopes are to use my talents to take me through this crazy thing called life. I plan on living somewhere warm like Florida or Arizona within a year. 
    </p>
